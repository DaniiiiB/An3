My name is Batincu Daniel and I'm from group 931.
I am currently student at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science at Babes-Bolyai University in Cluj Napoca.
I love learning new things all the time, and this course is no different :)
To be honest, I'm more interested in programming, yet I find mathematics a bit fascinating. I still have no favorite algorithms / theorems :(
